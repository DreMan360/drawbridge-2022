# Drawbridge 2022
A drawbridge that I made for a school competition. Designed and programmed by me, and constructed by two of my friends

It was originally intended to be a bascule bridge, but the wiring and programming ended up taking roughly 2-3 days, meaning we didn't have enough time to finish it. However, it still managed to win first place in one of the three categories. Creativity.
